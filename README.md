# Image-Blending

## Type: Academic Individual Project

## Project Description
NCSU ECE 558 (Digital Imaging Systems) Project 2
  - Implement functions for Gaussian/Laplacian pyramid image blending in Python

## Dependencies:
  - numpy
  - cv2
  - Spyder IDE (used), Linux, or Anaconda on Windows 10 Education
  
## About the Repo.
  - kddo_code contains **P1_q1.py**, **P2_Packages.py**, and **main.py** that are carefully commented 
    - **P1_q1.py** reuses the 2-D convolution and padding functions from **ECE 558 (Digital Imaging Systems) Project 1**.  The file is used as a Python module to import necessary helper functions in **P2_Packages.py**
    - **P2_Packages.py** implements the LoG pyramid algorithm and is used as a Python module to import helper functions in **main.py**
  - kddo_images contains folders of three image pairs.  Each pair contains a folder of orginal images and result images
  - Final report details the implementations of the functions in this project along with the results + analysis
